# Flipper Application Packages (FAPs)

The long-awaited addition of loading plugins (applications) from the SD card is here thanks to some hard work by the Official Flipper devteam. Anna/hedger released a FAP pack with some pre-built plugins, ready to go. Check out the [Official documentation](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware/blob/dev/documentation/AppsOnSDCard.md) for more info.

And thanks to some further hard work from [xMasterX](https://github.com/xMasterX) of [Unleashed](https://github.com/Eng1n33r/flipperzero-firmware), we now have MORE working applications!

Since the FAP file needs to be compiled to work with the specific firmware you have, I've separated the FAPs into their respective folders.

**Currently RogueMaster FAP files, previously made and currently released, are *not* working! You'll need to wait for a new release.**

## How to use

Download the FAP file(s) of your choice and stick them in a folder names `apps` on the SD card. You can organize them into folders like they are on this repo however you would like! Please, move them around to what makes sense to you, create new folders, etc.

Once you have them loaded, make sure you're on the most current version of your [firmware of choice](https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper/tree/main/Firmware_Options) (dev branch in most cases), then look for the Applications menu item:

Hit the center button to load it and you should see your folders from above:

Now simply navigate to the application you'd like to load and center click it!

To exit and/or load something else, simply use the BACK button.
